            Hello There!
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal with this website was to practice, and <i>show off</i> my
            skills React, MYSQL, Nodejs, Axios etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            The website is a book manager, which allows us to view books data in
            a table. We cane add new books, update or delete existing ones. Also
            we can do the same things with book genres, and publishers.
            <br />
            <br />
            The websites style is pretty ugly. That's because my main goal
            wasn't to make it look nice, but to make it functional.
